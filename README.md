# discollection-viewer

This is a viewer for output of the `organize` command from the [discollection CLI project](https://github.com/dainguyendo/discollection). The output of the `organize` command is a JSON file that contains your organized Discogs library collection. You can take that JSON file and upload it to this viewer to see your collection in it's organized state.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
